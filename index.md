Hi, I'm Hudson. I currently work at [D33](https://dispensary33.com/) in Illinois's legal cannabis industry where I do things like:

- writing cannabis business license applications on behalf of social equity applicants
- managing research projects across multiple facets of business, including legal, GIS, business development and data analytics
- scaling and automating core business processes and assisting with IT growth strategy

Formerly, I was an academic researcher working at the intersection of technology, mental health and social issues. I built VR studies for experimental neuroscience, prototyped VR psychiatric interventions, and conducted ethnographic research on digital health. I received my MA in *Anthropology* and *Science and Technology Studies* from the University of Chicago and my BA in *Neuroscience* from Oberlin College.
